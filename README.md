## Mechanical Breakdown :wrench:
Our car uses primarily **3D printed PLA filament** as the structural material. We used the **[Prusa MK4S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mk4s-3d-printer-5/)** from Prusa Research, as well as the **`[JOHN'S PRINTER].**` 3D printing allows precise designing of parts, and PLA is readily available and easily accessible for commercial 3D printing. Our CAD softwares of choice were **[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)**, as well as **[TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)** for simpler geometry. We strongly recommend these two softwares for basic component design, as they are generally easy to learn, and provide convenient online cloud storage.

Provided below are models of the 3D printed parts, individually, as well as on the final car.

These parts were designed with **modularity** in mind, meaning each section of the car can function more or less individually. They piece together smoothly as separate parts, instead of a single printed chassis. 

We found this much more convenient while testing, as it allows for edits to be made to a specific part of the car, and easily replaced and updated without collateral impact to the rest of the body.
